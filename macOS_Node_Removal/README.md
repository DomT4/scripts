terminatenode.sh
=======

To execute the script run either `/path/to/terminatenode.sh` or
`./terminatenode.sh` from this directory.

This is an *extremely* methodical script that attempts to **completely**
remove `node` & `npm` from your system. The script could be compacted but is
deliberately exploded to enable people to see exactly what the script is doing.

This script is only tested on macOS.
